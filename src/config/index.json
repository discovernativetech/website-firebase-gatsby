He passes on the rich heritage of the Orang Asli through outdoor activities in the jungle, and the preservation of cultural arts and crafts. <br/><br/> After taking a 2-year break since his wife's passing, he has decided to co-create a Native experience with us in hopes to restore the village's pioneering campsite gradually to it's former livelihood."

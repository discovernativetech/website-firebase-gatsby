        "experienceSummary": "Embark on a 3-4 hour journey through the village of Kampung Sungai Lalang Bahru and their neighbouring forests. This adventure will allow guests to experience Orang Asli culture through the eyes of the people who have been its custodians for thousands of years. Our Native hosts from the Temuan Tribe will act as both guides and teachers, sharing indigenous knowledge and stories along the path with insights on flora and fauna, cultural beliefs, and even their modern day struggles. Guests will then be given access to a host’s home where you enjoy a post-hike homecooked lunch of Temuan dishes with his family.",
